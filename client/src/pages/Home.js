              Deep Learning for Online Fashion: A Novel Solution for the Retail
              E-Commerce Industry. The online shopping experience for clothing
              can be further enhanced by implementing Deep Learning techniques,
              such as Computer Vision and personalized recommendation systems.
              Automation, as a principle, can be applied to solving problems
              surrounding efficacy, efficiency, and security. It also provides a
              layer of abstraction for the user during the online shopping
              experience. This research aims to apply Deep Learning methods and
              principles of automation to augment the e-commerce fashion market
              in a novel way. After using these methods, it was found that
              Convolutional Autoencoders and Item-to-Item Based Recommenders may
              be used to accurately and precisely recommend articles of clothing
              based on a usersâ€™ styling preferences.

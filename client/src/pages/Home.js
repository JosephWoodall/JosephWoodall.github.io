        I am a Data Scientist and Data Engineer with experience in statistical
        analytics in cloud and local environments with notable skills in Python,
        R, SAS, SQL, and Tableau. I have constructed pipelines for customer data
        to populate a database to improve cross-functional data access for
        analytics. Broadly, my industry data science experience covers process
        science, and product and manufacturing analysis in the FinTech,
        Logistics and Shipping Services, and Automobile industries.

        Deep Learning for Online Fashion: A Novel Solution for the Retail
        E-Commerce Industry
      </div>
      <div>
        The online shopping experience for clothing can be further enhanced by
        implementing Deep Learning techniques, such as Computer Vision and
        personalized recommendation systems. Automation, as a principle, can be
        applied to solving problems surrounding efficacy, efficiency, and
        security. It also provides a layer of abstraction for the user during
        the online shopping experience. This research aims to apply Deep
        Learning methods and principles of automation to augment the e-commerce
        fashion market in a novel way. After using these methods, it was found
        that Convolutional Autoencoders and Item-to-Item Based Recommenders may
        be used to accurately and precisely recommend articles of clothing based
        on a usersâ€™ styling preferences.
